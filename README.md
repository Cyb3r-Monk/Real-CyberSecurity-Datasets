# Real-CyberSecurity-Datasets
Public datasets to help you address various cyber security problems using Machine Learning.

## The ADFA Intrusion Detection Datasets

The datasets cover both Linux and Windows; they are designed for evaluation by system call based HIDS.

## Botnet and Ransomware Detection Datasets

The ISOT Botnet dataset is the combination of several existing publicly available malicious and non-malicious datasets.

##  Malicious URLs Dataset

The long-term goal of this research is to construct a real-time system that uses machine learning techniques to detect malicious URLs (spam, phishing, exploits, and so on). To this end, we have explored techniques that involve classifying URLs based on their lexical and host-based features, as well as online learning to process large numbers of examples and adapt quickly to evolving URLs over time.

## Cloud Security Datasets

The ISOT Cloud IDS (ISOT CID) dataset consists of over 8Tb data collected in a real cloud environment and includes network traffic at VM and hypervisor levels, system logs, performance data (e.g. CPU utilization), and system calls.

_"The dataset cannot be downloaded directly. Instead you need first to fill an agreement about how the data will be used;"_

## Dynamic Malware Analysis Kernel and User-Level Calls

This dataset contains the data collected from Cuckoo and our own kernel driver after running 1000 malicious and 1000 clean samples.

## Stratosphereips Datasets

The Stratosphere IPS feeds itself with models created from real malware traffic captures. By using and studying how malware behaves in reality, we ensure the models we create are accurate and our measurements of performance are real.

* The CTU-13 Dataset. A Labeled Dataset with Botnet, Normal and Background traffic.
* Malware Capture Facility Project.
* Malware on IoT Dataset.
* Aposemat IoT-23 (A labeled dataset with malicious and benign IoT network traffic).
* The Android Mischief Dataset.

## Windows Malware Dataset with PE API Calls

Public malware dataset generated by Cuckoo Sandbox based on Windows OS API calls analysis for cyber security researchers for malware analysis in csv file format for machine learning applications.
